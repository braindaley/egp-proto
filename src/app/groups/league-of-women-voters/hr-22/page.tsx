      <h3>Why LWV Opposes the SAVE Act (H.R. 22)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>It creates unnecessary barriers to voting.</strong> Although voters are already required to affirm citizenship when registering, the SAVE Act adds redundant requirements, such as presenting documentary proof of U.S. citizenship in person every time you update your registration. This puts an unfair burden on many eligible voters.</li>
        <li><strong>It disproportionately impacts marginalized groups.</strong> The League highlights how the SAVE Act harms rural voters, voters of color, military families who move frequently, those recovering from disasters, and especially married women who've changed their names and may struggle to match documentation.</li>
        <li><strong>It addresses a problem that doesn't exist.</strong> Noncitizen voting is already illegal and extremely rare. The League warns that the SAVE Act is rooted in fear, misinformation, and divisive rhetoricâ€”not real threats to democracy.</li>
        <li><strong>It undermines voter access and overloads election infrastructure.</strong> Requiring in-person registrations and strict document checks could overwhelm local election offices and undermine the League's century-long mission of encouraging broad participation.</li>
      </ul>
