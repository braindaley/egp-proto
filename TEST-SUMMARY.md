## 🚀 Test Results

```bash
Test Suites: 5 passed, 5 total
Tests:       47 passed, 47 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        ~9 seconds
```

### **Coverage Areas:**
- ✅ Business Logic: Core functionality validation
- ✅ Data Validation: Input/output format checking
- ✅ Error Handling: Graceful failure scenarios
- ✅ User Flows: Multi-step process validation
- ✅ API Integration: Endpoint parameter validation
- ✅ State Management: Watch lists and user data

## 📋 How to Run Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test patterns
npm test -- --testPathPattern="simple|census|watch-functionality|advocacy-utils"

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

## 🎉 Summary

I have successfully created a comprehensive test suite covering all major updates from the past 7 days. The tests focus on:

1. **Functional validation** of new features
2. **Data integrity** for census and user information  
3. **Workflow validation** for multi-step processes
4. **Error handling** for robust user experience
5. **Business logic** verification for core functionality

The test suite provides confidence that the recent updates are working correctly and will help catch regressions in future development. All 47 tests are passing, indicating that the implemented functionality is working as expected.

### **Next Steps:**
- Tests are ready to run in CI/CD pipeline
- Can be extended with additional component-level tests as needed
- Coverage reports available via `npm run test:coverage`
- Integration tests can be added for full end-to-end workflows
