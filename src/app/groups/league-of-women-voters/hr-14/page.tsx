      <h3>Why LWV Supports the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>It restores protections weakened by court decisions.</strong> After the 2013 <em>Shelby County v. Holder</em> ruling gutted key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, this legislation is seen as essential to reestablish federal oversight and guard against discriminatory changes in voting laws.</li>
        <li><strong>It defends democracy and honors the VRA's legacy.</strong> Named for civil rights hero John Lewis, the bill is framed as much-needed defense of voting rightsâ€”particularly amid renewed state-level attacks on fair representation and redistricting.</li>
        <li><strong>It aligns with LWV's mission.</strong> The League has a long history of fighting to make elections fair, inclusive, and accessible. This act fits squarely within that mission by preventing racial discrimination and ensuring every voter is heard.</li>
      </ul>
